		<p>Our team conducted a multi-methodology approach to research to understand how users currently plan and travel. We surveyed over 40 participants (N=44). The survey was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data regarding podcasts, walking tours and the planning process for trips. Secondly, we interviewed 7 individuals (N=7) planning a trip or who recently traveled. The interview covered the participant's traveling history, planning experience, and the tools that they have used in the past.</p>

			<div class="insight "><p class="keynumber">2</p><p>Podcasts are popular and people often multi-task while listening to them. Tasks performed while listening to podcasts tend to be daily responsibilities.</p></div>
			<div class="insight "><p class="keynumber">3</p><p>People use a wide variety of resources and tools, often multiple at a time, to assist with travel.</p></div>
			<div class="insight "><p class="keynumber">4</p><p>People tend to enjoy historical or walking tours because they can aid in travel planning and provide a unique insight into a place’s culture or history. However, there are frustrations with being in a group setting whether due to other members in the tour group or constraints from being unable to go at their own pace.</p></div>

					<br>Our participants voiced that they had difficulty filtering through the information to find pertinent information for their travel. Participants reported having to switch through multiple tools and resources to discover different activities to do.
					<br><br>

					<i>Therefore, we should provide the ability to filter information and recommendations for activities based on the participants’ constraints. </i></p></div>
				<div class="reccomendations">
					<p class="keynumber">3</p>
					<p><span class="rectitle">Support sharing between parties</span>
					<br>Our participants voiced that communication between the group while planning, traveling and reflecting on travel was difficult to share information. Changing or altering plans was also difficult to do. 
					<br><br>

					<i>Therefore, we should provide the ability to share information between the group in order to better plan, change or share activities.</i> </p></div>

Our participants discussed not having a desire to attend a tour because of this.<br><br>

					<i>Therefore, we should provide the ability to have independent experiences that are customizable yet share a similar experience to a walking tour.</i> </p></div>

					<p class="keynumber">7</p>
					<p><span class="rectitle">Support smaller time-intensive activities</span><br>Participants expressed frustrations with walking tours being too long to fit within their specific timeframes. Because travel plans are not flexible, participants discussed wanting more customization to better fit their travel interests and schedule.<br><br>

					<i>Therefore, we should provide the ability to have shorter experiences, organized by interest that can be built into a longer experience.</i> </p></div>

		<p>Our team asked 7 individuals to engage with our Figma prototype. We collected feedback in various ways, including a list of tasks for them, time to explore the app freely and to verbalize their joys and discomforts.<br><br>

We found that many of our participants were confused over the same tasks within our prototype: the process of finding a premade journey and deleting an activity within an itinerary. <br><br>

Overall, the participants discussed that the experience felt intuitive despite those challenges. We will be implementing these changes on our final prototype.</p>
