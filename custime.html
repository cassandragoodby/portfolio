    	    <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="title">Introduction</p>
            <p class="content">This project was made in collaboration of Design for the Web and Advanced Mobile Application Development. The goal was to design a mobile application, a landing page and develop the app in iOS and android. </p>
            <p class="title">Tools</p>
            <p class="content">Sketch, Illustrator, Photoshop, Android Studio, Xcode</p>
            <p class="title">Duration</p>
            <p class="content">Semester-Spring 2018</p>
            <p class="titlebig">Process</p>
            <p class="title">User Research</p>
            <p class="content">For this project I decided to use myself as the user. Prior to this project I was annoyed with my process timing my gym workouts. I had tried what felt like every app on my phone and settled on using notes with a written workout plan and the timer app. In between every workout I would flip back to my notes to see what was next in my set and then switch back to the timer and restart it. Other apps did not allow me to customize my workout fully with the workouts and timer. I settled on creating CusTime a custom workout timer app. I went through the user research process with myself which was an interesting practice.</p>
            <p class="title">Objective</p>
            <p class="content">Design and develop a customizable timer app for working out. Also design a brand and landing page for the application. </p>
            <p class="title">Pain Points to Solve</p>
            <p class="content">1.   Save workouts feature<br>
2.  Customize workouts<br>
3.  Customize timer settings<br>
</p>

            <p class="title">Solution</p>
            <p class="content">I ended with a full designed mobile application, website landing page for the mobile application, a fully developed iOS app and android app. For the app design I created a modern simple interface. I wanted to mobile app to be easy to use to not interfere with a userâ€™s workout. For the landing page I wanted to steer away from typical workout apps and focus on the clean minimalism of the technology to match the interface of the mobile app. <br><br>For the development portion of this project I got to a point where each of the apps work and are simply designed. My next step with the mobile apps would be to add data persistence as well as do beta testing of each app.  <br><br>This workout timer app is created for the workout enthusiast who wants to be able to customize and set their workout to exactly what they need for the timer. Choose from a preset list of available workout ideas, add custom ones or simply use one of your old tried and true workouts you have saved before. Finally you can get the customization and simplicity that your workout app deserves.</p>
            <p class="title">Mobile Application Development</p>
            <p class="content">For this app I natively developed in Xcode for iOS and Android Studio.</p>

            <p class="title">Takeaways</p>
            <p class="content">My takeaways from this project were around the process of design vs developing. To bring a user interface design it has to be coded which can be different for Android vs iOS. This also was an important lesson of the minimal viable product. During the development phase for the mobile application I was reminded to keep the app simple but well designed to test the idea. This helped in the design and development process to focus on what is important for the user as well as what is the most important aspect of the idea. </p>
